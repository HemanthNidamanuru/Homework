                Hi all,I came from a tiny town called Vijayawada. I earned an Undergraduate degree in Electronics and
                Communication from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kollam.

            </p>
            <p>
                After that, I decided to pursue my goal of becoming a web developer and began developing websites for
                acquaintances before enrolling at Purdue University.I am well versed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my professional education, I am interested in exploring emerging themes in web
                development.
                My hobbies include traveling and outdoor sporting activities.
                Finally, I am the type of person who wants to use my career to benefit society.
            </p>
